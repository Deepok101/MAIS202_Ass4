# MAIS202_Ass4
I wrote the jupyter notebook file on Google Collab which required me to use Google Drive's cloud storage to keep the data.
If downloading the repo, remove the "/content/drive/My Drive/Ass4/ass4/mais202-fall2019/" from each data import.

You can run the jupyter notebook file from beginning to end.
The last cell with submission_export(model) will export it to inside the mais202-fall2019 folder as submission.csv.
